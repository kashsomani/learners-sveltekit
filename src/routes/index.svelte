                Learnersâ€™ Academy was established in June 1983 with only
                Pre-Primary and Primary sections. Today, we have classes up to
                Std. X (I.C.S.E.). We have grown with our children to give our
                community a home where learning begins and from where emerge the
                citizens of tomorrow. We have cutting-edge technologies coupled
                with experienced teachers to cater to the intrinsic as well as
                extrinsic devlopments of all children. With STEM being our
                primary focus, our alumni have consistently gone forward to work
                in various industries such as medicine, engineering, technology
                and many more
